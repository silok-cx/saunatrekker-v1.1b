--------------------------------------------------------
It's related to the design and behavior of the Amiga Protracker Series from the 1980s/90s.
Not an exact clone but it takes the spirit of the Aera.

How to use it ?

You can use it like all the Sound/Noise/Protrackers from the Amiga etc.
With one restriction. It's working only with the Amiga VBlank speed,
not with the Tempo(BPM) timing.

Additionally there are some special functions.

Function Keys
-------------
F1-F2 = Octave Change
F4 = Change Stereoseperation 0/50/100
F5 = Change Key-Map US/DE
F7 = Copy Block
F8 = Paste Block
F9-F10 = Turn on/off Channels

Copy & Paste Tracks
-------------------

Hold the SHIFT-Key and navigate with the cursor or mouseroll up and down.
Press F7 for copy a Block. Navigate to the Track and row you want to paste it and press F8.

Transpose Notes
---------------

Navigate into the Track you wish to transpose the notes. Press plus or minus to
transpose the notes up and down.

Config.ini File
---------------

You can change a bunch of parameters in this file.

The configfile format is as follow:

scale; - INT = Multiplies the scaling like 1x 2x etc. ( Example for 2x scaling: 2; )
